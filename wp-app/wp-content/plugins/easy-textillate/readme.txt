Very beautiful text animations (shortcodes in posts and widgets or PHP code in theme files).

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to add animation to any text using shortcodes in posts, pages or site widgets. You can also use PHP code to add text animations directly in theme files.

The plugin fully utilizes the capabilities of the <strong>Textillate.js</strong> script and is very easy to use – you don’t need to spend time including scripts and style files. Just create a shortcode with the necessary animation and paste it into your post.

<strong>Easy Textillate</strong> uses the following libraries:

* [textillate.js](https://jschr.github.io/textillate/) by Jordan Schroter
* [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) by Daniel Eden
* [lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com/) by Dave Rupert
